# Note to use this Socrata API URL for the NOLA data as it returns ECMAScript
# formatted dates. The other URLs on NOLA's open data portal
# (https://data.nola.gov/City-Administration/311-Calls-Historic-Data-2012-2018-/3iz8-nghx)
# return date strings in non ECMAScript format and won't work with the date
# filters on the tool. This URL is based on the Socrata API CSV download url,
# but with a user added limit parameter to get all the results in one call.
